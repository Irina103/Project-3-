# Project-3-
code 
In this repository I include all the code (Rstudio) that I produced for my project3 
that includes all the small examples that I used to explain the theory concepts and also my final simuation on interpolation Big data via NNGP which what we use with big data since normal GP wouldn't work 

To use the code, you would need to install the data set modis_temps.RData and also the Rstudio and then simply copy and pase the bit of the code you are interseted in
